## Scaling to More Nodes

Sometimes you need more Kubernetes infrastructure to run more applications. DC/OS can easily scale the cluster. 

There are several ways to scale Kubernetes in DC/OS. From the UI, go to Services > Kubernetes and choose "Edit" in top right. 

Under "kubernetes" in left hand menu, change the number of "node count" to 2
