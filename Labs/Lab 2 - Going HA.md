### Making Kubernetes Highly Available

You can choose to make Kubernetes on DC/OS high availability (HA) at the time of deployment. However, you can also make non-HA clusters into HA by editing and saving the configuration. 

In the DC/OS UI under Services, click on your Kubernetes cluster (Not kube-proxy). 

In the top left, click Edit.
